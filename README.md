# 150-days-of-code
Personal challenge to code 1h for 150 consecutive days.
Inspired by the original (100 days of code)[https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code] 100 days of code.

## My own rules for this challenge are:
- Code 1h per day (outside working hours)
- Most of the time should be coding, not passively reading/watching courses.
- Allowance of 1 rest day per week (can carry over)
- Each day I'll write to the log.md file with the progress for that day + my feelings about it 
- Publicly share progress on X everyday (not heavily enforced)
