#### Set-up challenge
**Description**: What it says on the tin, made a simple bash script for logging entries and set up the rules (yes that took the whole hour, I also spent a huge time trying to remember which online course I was following)
**Feelings**: Felt great UwU

#### Checking HTML tags
**Description**: Starteed simple exercise for checking if the html tags match in a html file.

**Feelings**: Today was chill and slayfull, am still feeling focused but need to go to sleep. But it was annoying that the stupid ifstream is not opening the file properly and I have no clue why.

#### Fixed issue with I/O files
**Description**: Implemented a write and read of html file

**Feelings**: Literally spent the whole hour on something so simple as figurining out that paths need to writen relative to the o the EXECUTABLE objectt, not the CPP file, which makes perfect sense but I guess you get used to bad habits when you code in Python. Emotionally wise it was very slayful, I actually managed to (dareisay) *enjoy* myself.

#### Did palindrome checker
**Description**: What it says on the title lol

**Feelings**: I am not sure how I spent so much time doing such a simple exercise lol. Today I was very focused at work so overall felt very slayful. 10/10

#### Linked List
**Description**: Read through the intro to making a LinkedList class and tried implementing my own version without relying on the guide. Actually took much longer than expected and it is still not working :/

**Feelings**: I felt pretty good, not amazing but also not too frustrated. Getting started did suck though and I procrastinated a lot before it xD

#### Remove method for linked list
**Description**: Spent most of the time correcting previous methods of the linked list and adding a new remove method.

**Feelings**: Really amazing actually, since this is the first thing I am doing right after waking up. I am going to London today. Slay.
