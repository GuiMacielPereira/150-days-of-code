#### Checking HTML tags
**Description**: Starteed simple exercise for checking if the html tags match in a html file.

**Feelings**: Today was chill and slayfull, am still feeling focused but need to go to sleep. But it was annoying that the stupid ifstream is not opening the file properly and I have no clue why.
