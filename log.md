#### Set-up challenge
**Description**: What it says on the tin, made a simple bash script for logging entries and set up the rules (yes that took the whole hour, I also spent a huge time trying to remember which online course I was following)
**Feelings**: Felt great UwU


### 2024-03-26 20:43:22
#### Checking HTML tags
**Description**: Starteed simple exercise for checking if the html tags match in a html file.

**Feelings**: Today was chill and slayfull, am still feeling focused but need to go to sleep. But it was annoying that the stupid ifstream is not opening the file properly and I have no clue why.


### 2024-03-27 20:35:10
#### Fixed issue with I/O files
**Description**: Implemented a write and read of html file

**Feelings**: Literally spent the whole hour on something so simple as figurining out that paths need to writen relative to the o the EXECUTABLE objectt, not the CPP file, which makes perfect sense but I guess you get used to bad habits when you code in Python. Emotionally wise it was very slayful, I actually managed to (dareisay) *enjoy* myself.


### 2024-03-28 20:24:45
#### Did palindrome checker
**Description**: What it says on the title lol

**Feelings**: I am not sure how I spent so much time doing such a simple exercise lol. Today I was very focused at work so overall felt very slayful. 10/10

#### Linked List
**Description**: Read through the intro to making a LinkedList class and tried implementing my own version without relying on the guide. Actually took much longer than expected and it is still not working :/

**Feelings**: I felt pretty good, not amazing but also not too frustrated. Getting started did suck though and I procrastinated a lot before it xD


### 2024-03-30 08:27:30
#### Remove method for linked list
**Description**: Spent most of the time correcting previous methods of the linked list and adding a new remove method.

**Feelings**: Really amazing actually, since this is the first thing I am doing right after waking up. I am going to London today. Slay.


### 2024-03-31 11:27:33
#### Finished linked list
**Description**: Added methods insert, append and index.

**Feelings**: The same as yesterday, really, did this first thing in the morning so I was focused and time went by quickly


### 2024-04-01 08:30:28
#### Ordered linked list
**Description**: Started separating files to play around with inheritance and ordered lists but I got stuck on something stupid that Ianot understanding why it's not working.

**Feelings**: I am actually a bit hungover this morning and overall was not feeling it but it wasn't too bad.


### 2024-04-02 20:57:50
#### Almost finished ordered linked list
**Description**: Found out that its easy to get inheritance wrong when using templates. Need to use this->method to make method work with inherited classes. Added small modification to OrderedLinkedList

**Feelings**: I was quite tired actually and it was a struggle to get started. But overall it went quite smoothlyly. I found a really interesting behaviuor of using inheritance with templates so I am satisfied.


### 2024-04-03 20:53:56 - Day 10
#### Finished linked list
**Description**: Added a better checking for the case where inserting nodes on an ordered linked list

**Feelings**: Honestly today was a SLOG. I finished a tiny correction early and then stalled for the rest of the time becaue I did NOT want to start the chapter exercises. But having read the exercises, they seem straightforward enough.


### 2024-04-04 20:55:09 - Day 11
#### Implemented queue using a foward list
**Description**: The implementation was easy but for some reason I can't decrement the pointer to the last element

**Feelings**: Eh today was okay, towards the end I couldn't resist and looked up an interesting perfume brand that I have been looking at lately.


### 2024-04-06 13:49:20 - Day 12
#### Fixed issue with end iterator of forward list
**Description**: Replaced using a forward list with a list (double linked) so that I can decrement list.end() to the previous value. Aalso I was today years old when I found out ++i and i++ return entirely different things. ++i returns reference to the incremented object, i++ retns copy to object before increment. Really had no idea about this, but I understand now why it was breaking my code

**Feelings**: Uhmmmmmmmmmm relly not productive at alllllll, it started badly by having my roomate blast the TV in his room the entire time, I don't understand why someone would have the need to watch a TV show that loudly.


### 2024-04-07 10:14:07 - Day 13
#### MOdified some methods for linked list
**Description**: Did better implementation of size() and started implementing slice() method. Also confirmed that using push and pop on a doubly linked list is O(1) (same as queue)

**Feelings**: I was tired and not massively productive but overall it went fine


### 2024-04-08 20:59:36 - Day 14
#### Looking into polymorphism
**Description**: Tried to do something I think is not allowed

**Feelings**: I wonder if it is possible to define a virtual function in a parent class whose different behaviour in its children class is to return the type of the children. Otherwise the code needs to be repeated twice in each implementation at each child class :/


### 2024-04-09 20:54:35 - Day 15
#### Finished slice implementation
**Description**: I gave up trying to do a virtual function and ended up implementing the slice capability whithin the OrderedLinkedList.

**Feelings**: It was okay, not massively productive.


### 2024-04-11 08:34:19 - Day 16
#### Set base for doubly linked list
**Description**: Doing a doubly linked list from the top of my head, I should be able to improve the remove and insert algorithms by looping simultaneously from the front and back

**Feelings**: Pretty good, today's session was a bit reduced in time, but I made up for it by paying more attention


### 2024-04-12 18:52:19 - Day 17
#### Implemented search function for double linked list
**Description**: I am literally sitting in an art deco caffe trying to implement a loop that starts from both the head and tail of a linked list. My implementation was correct at first but I wasted the entire hour debugging a typo that I had made into the print out statements (hence why I was super confused as to why my implementation was not working)

**Feelings**: Today I am feeling okay, spent the day in sunny scorching hot portugal and am now working from a nivce caffe so it went fine I guess? I don't know, I do like my routines, this kind of travelling kills my body (yes I am 25)


### 2024-04-14 00:17:54 - Day 18
#### Made method for removing from linked list
**Description**: THe implementation is working but it looks a bit messy, I wonder how I could make it more elegant

**Feelings**: Todya I started working late because I spend the entire day at the beach, got a tiny bit sunburnt and procrastinated doing this hour. I was tired and really not feeling it but after I started I somehow kept going?? Anyways I have a new implementation for the remove method.


### 2024-04-15 12:20:21 - Day 19
#### Finished doubly linked list class
**Description**: Added method for inserting nodes

**Feelings**: Pretty good, I am actually doing this in the following day because yesterday I felt exhausted, and Iwould rather sleep.
